# Ceramic Job Slap

An application to demonstrate the Basic Skill DataModel submitted to the [Ceramic DataModels](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels) repository.

Part of the [Gitcoin Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/80/100026723).

## About The Application

The application allows users to add skills to their decentralized identity.

They can add simple skills with just a name, description and image. This can be used as part of a CV that requires no central body like LinkedIn to control.

Alternatively, they may be sent verified skills from an official issuing body with a signature. This will be in JSON format and they can upload this via a textarea. This can then be used by other applications to verfiy that this person has those skills.

For example, this facility will allow for decentralized gaming environments to share the skills of a gamer so that will already have access to skill learned in previous games when beginning to play something new.

## Ceramic

Ceramic is a platform for storing and sharing streams of data.

Examples of streams are a social media feed, a list of transactions, and a collaborative document. Anything where changes are made over time.

The Ceramic system is designed to provide [Self-Sovereign Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity) and data.

In Ceramic you control your own identities and the data that is recorded with them. This is in contrast to social media companies, who control your feed; a centralized bank, that controls your transactions, or a cloud provider like Google/AWS that controls your documents. 

The system is also decentralized, providing censorship resistance.
